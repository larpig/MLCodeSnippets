This repository contains code snippets for machine learning in Python.

## How are files organized?

Files are generally Jupyter Notebooks whose name presents the following format:

CodeSnippet_`<machine learning type>`_`<problem solved>`

Example: CodeSnippet_Clustering_DeterminingTheAlgirhtmAndTheNumberOfClusters.
